# My App - Progressive Web App

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## PWA Features

- ✅ **Offline Support**: Works offline with service worker caching
- ✅ **Installable**: Can be installed on devices like a native app
- ✅ **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- ✅ **Fast Loading**: Optimized with service worker caching strategies
- ✅ **App-like Experience**: Standalone display mode without browser UI

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**Note**: PWA features are disabled in development mode. To test PWA functionality:
